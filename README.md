# Soldering Station

In this Github repository are all the files I used to make a soldering station with a custom PCB and a case to protect it.

This self-made solering station is a school project at 'Hogeschool PXL' for the 'Project-Ontwerpen' subject in the first year of the 'Electronica-ICT' course.
The .gcode files are for a Creality Ender 3 V2 3D printer.

# Made by:
Cosemans Lucas + lectors at PXL
